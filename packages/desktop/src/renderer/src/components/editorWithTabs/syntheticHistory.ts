// Synthetic save-tracking history for the WYSIWYG engine.
//
// The `@muyajs/core` engine's undo/redo history (`getHistory()`) has a
// different shape than the desktop store's `tab.history` (which drives the
// save/dirty indicator). The renderer therefore feeds the store a SYNTHETIC,
// desktop-shaped history whose single stack entry carries an `id` the store
// compares against `tab.lastSavedHistoryId`: when the current id equals the
// saved id the tab is shown as clean, otherwise dirty.
//
// The id MUST satisfy two properties:
//   1. clean  <=> the live document content matches the saved-on-disk content.
//   2. monotonic & never-reused: a divergent edit can never collide with the
//      saved id, even when it returns the engine undo-stack to the same DEPTH.
//
// An earlier implementation used the undo-stack DEPTH as the id. Depth is
// REUSED across distinct documents at the same stack height, so the sequence
//   type A, type B, save, undo B, type C  (a NEW divergent edit)
// returned the depth — and therefore the id — to the saved value while the
// document was actually A+C, falsely showing the tab as clean and risking
// data loss on close-without-save (Phase G — G6).
//
// Legacy muyajs avoided this by assigning every pushed history entry a
// MONOTONIC, never-reused id and splicing the redo tail on a new edit. We
// reproduce the exact semantics here, but keyed on the live document content
// rather than on the engine's internal stack objects (the engine regenerates
// its undo operations via invert on every undo/redo, so object identity is not
// stable). Each DISTINCT content snapshot is assigned a fresh monotonic id the
// first time it is seen; revisiting an earlier snapshot (undo/redo back to it)
// reuses that snapshot's original id. Undoing back to the saved content
// therefore restores the saved id (clean); a divergent re-edit produces brand
// new content and hence a brand new id (dirty) — never the saved one.

// Trailing newlines are NOT meaningful content for save/dirty tracking — the
// store itself normalizes them via `adjustTrailingNewlines`/`trimTrailingNewline`
// before saving. The engine's markdown serialization is also unstable across a
// `setContent` -> edit -> undo round-trip purely in trailing newlines (loading
// `'x\n'` may serialize to `'x\n\n\n'`, while undoing an edit lands on `'x\n'`),
// so the content signature must ignore them or undo-to-saved would never match.
const stripTrailingNewlines = (content: string): string =>
  content.replace(/[\r\n]+$/, '')

// A fast, stable 64-bit string hash (FNV-1a) over the trailing-newline-normalized
// content. Used so the content -> id map stores short keys instead of whole
// documents; a collision would map two genuinely different documents to the same
// id and could reintroduce the false-clean it guards against. 64 bits keeps the
// collision probability negligible even for a long editing session with many
// thousands of distinct snapshots (a 32-bit hash hits ~50% collision odds near
// ~77k snapshots via the birthday bound — realistic over a long session — so the
// extra width is worth the BigInt key).
