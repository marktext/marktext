This work may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions
of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3c of this

Please also observe the following clause:
1) it is requested, but not legally required, that derived works be

   We recommend the manifest be given in a separate file named

   we recommend a name of the form README-<fontid>.txt.
